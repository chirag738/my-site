Hello everyone, my name is Chirag Moolya. This is my first project in web development. I have made this project along with my 3 other group mates Keshav Desai, Mayur Gangurde and Marlon Dabreo. The frontend of this website is made using html and css. The backend development is done using the python framework i.e django. Basically, this site is a crime reporting portal. But as we are working on the project, we haven't hosted the website. The site is still under progress but we'll wrap up the project as soon as possible.
