This is my first project in web development. The frontend of this website is made using html and css. The backend development is done using the python framework i.e django. Basically, this site is a crime reporting portal. But as we are working on the project, we haven't hosted the website. The site is still under progress but we'll wrap up the project as soon as possible. You can access this project by creating a new branch and pull request by creating a clone. To run the project, type the command "python manage.py runserver" on the terminal of your editor.
